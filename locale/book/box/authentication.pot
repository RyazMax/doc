When a client connects to a Tarantool instance, the instance sends a random `salt value <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29>`_ which the client must mix with the hashed-password before sending to the instance. Thus the original value ‘x’ is never stored anywhere except in the user’s head, and the hashed value is never passed down a network wire except when mixed with a random salt."

Nevertheless, administrators should warn users that no system is foolproof against determined long-term attacks, so passwords should be guarded and changed occasionally. Administrators should also advise users to choose long unobvious passwords, but it is ultimately up to the users to choose or change their own passwords."
