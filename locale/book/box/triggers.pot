msgid "Triggers have low overhead. If a trigger is not defined, then the overhead is minimal: merely a pointer dereference and check. If a trigger is defined, then its overhead is equivalent to the overhead of calling a function."

#: ../doc/book/box/triggers.rst:56
msgid "Triggers must work within the event context. However, effects are undefined if a function contains requests which normally could not occur immediately after the event, but only before the return from the event. For example, putting `os.exit() <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-os.exit>`_ or :ref:`box.rollback() <box-rollback>` in a trigger function would be bringing in requests outside the event context."

msgid "Triggers are replaceable. The request to \"redefine a trigger\" implies passing a new trigger function and an old trigger function to one of the \"on_event()\" functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/book/box/triggers.rst:67
msgid "The \"on_event()\" functions all have parameters which are function pointers, and they all return function pointers. Remember that a Lua function definition such as \"function f() x = x + 1 end\" is the same as \"f = function () x = x + 1 end\" -- in both cases ``f`` gets a function pointer. And \"trigger = box.session.on_connect(f)\" is the same as \"trigger = box.session.on_connect(function () x = x + 1 end)\" -- in both cases ``trigger`` gets the function pointer which was passed."
