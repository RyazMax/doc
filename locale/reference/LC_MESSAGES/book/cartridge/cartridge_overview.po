"A Tarantool cluster is a collection of Tarantool instances acting in "
"concert. While a single Tarantool instance can leverage the performance "
"of a single server and is vulnerable to failure, the cluster spans "
"multiple servers, utilizes their cumulative CPU power, and is fault-"
"tolerant."

"A Tarantool Cartridge cluster can segregate functionality between "
"instances via built-in and custom (user-defined) :ref:`cluster roles "
"<cartridge-roles>`. You can toggle instances on and off on the fly during"
" cluster operation. This allows you to put different types of workloads "
"(e.g., compute- and transaction-intensive ones) on different physical "
"servers with dedicated hardware."
