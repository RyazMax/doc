"Consider a distributed Tarantool cluster that consists of subclusters "

"The whole dataset is logically partitioned into a predefined number of "
":ref:`virtual buckets <vshard-vbuckets>` (further just **buckets**), each"

"several orders of magnitude larger than the potential number of cluster "
"nodes, even given future cluster scaling. For example, with M projected "
"nodes the dataset may be split into 100 * M or even 1,000 * M buckets. "
