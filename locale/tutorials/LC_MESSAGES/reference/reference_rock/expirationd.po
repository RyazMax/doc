"supplies on GitHub_ with an Artistic license. The ``expirationd.lua`` "
"program is lengthy (about 500 lines), so here we will only highlight the "
"matters that will be enhanced by studying the full source later."

"At this point, if the above explanation is worthwhile, it is clear that "
"``expirationd.lua`` starts a background routine (fiber) which iterates "
"through all the tuples in a space, sleeps cooperatively so that other "
"fibers can operate at the same time, and -- whenever it finds a tuple "
"that has expired -- deletes it from this space. Now the "
"\"``expirationd_run_task()``\" function can be used in a test which "
